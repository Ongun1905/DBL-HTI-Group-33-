        <h1>Visualization 1: MultiDiGraph</h1>
        <p>This visualization consists of a Network MultiDiGraph, where each node represents a user's e-mail address and each edge represents a message sent between two users. With the help of interactive tools, you can easily analyze the e-mail traffic of Enron's company.</p>

        <p>You can also hover over nodes in order to view their attributes, or you can click on a specific one in order to highlight it.</p>
